# Dream-Team

##About Project


Cricket is a game that is extremely prominent in India and Australia. It initially started in 
England in the sixteenth century and later spread to different nations, the first international 
game, however, isn't played in England, it was played between the United States and Canada 
in 1844. The cricket is played on an oval-shape playing field, there is no settled measurement 
for the field yet but the main action takes place on 15-yard territory which is known as the pitch 
the center of the huge playing field. 
Cricket, often hailed as a gentleman's game, has evolved into a fiercely competitive sport with 
a global fanbase. In the modern era, cricket teams are constantly seeking ways to optimize their 
performance on the field. One crucial aspect of achieving success in cricket is the selection of 
the best possible playing XI for each match. The composition of the playing XI can significantly 
impact a team's chances of winning matches across different formats of the game, including 
Test matches, One-Day Internationals (ODIs), and Twenty20 (T20) matches. 
There are many different versions of T20 one of the popular one is Indian Premier League (IPL) 
which is normally played in India and teams can is formed using mix of players from other 
countries so basically an Australian, South African and Indian team player can be in a same 
team. This project mainly focusses on T20 international format of the World cricket team. 
Traditionally, the process of selecting a cricket team has heavily relied on the expertise and 
intuition of team selectors, coaches, and captains. While experience and cricketing knowledge 
are invaluable assets in team selection, the advent of data analytics and technology has opened 
up new avenues for enhancing the decision-making process. By leveraging data-driven insights 
and statistical analysis, teams can make more informed decisions about player selection, team 
composition, and game strategies.


## Problem Definition 



There are many issues within the cricket field that I would like to address through this project, 
the most common problem such as inconsistent team selection, constant change in batting 
order, lack of match practice for reserve fast bowlers and inexperience spinners. I also want to 
address problems that are currently faced by Any cricket team across globe such as poor 
fielding, different bowling style, conceding too many extra and bowler orders. The analysis 
will help to overcome these problems by knowing exactly where things are going wrong. 



## Aims 
1. The first objective of the project is to find a dataset, which includes information about the 
Most of the cricket players and the matches. The data must be real and should contain 
detailed information based on the number of matches that player has played against other 
teams over the past years. The dataset is from ESPNCricInfo.com. website. 
2. The second objective will be focused on extracting and cleaning the dataset that are relevant 
to my project such as matches, players, opponent teams and batsman. This objective is very 
important for the project as this requires cleaning the data, correct and accurate information 
must be gathered to proceed. To distinguish the work literature review must be concluded, 
to see whether this project has been completed before or not, if yes what is there that can 
be improved. 
3. The third objective will be to compare the matches, player and team performance in terms 
of score and result. The outcome this objective will play important role when doing 
analysis. 
4. The fourth objective is to transfer the clean data and generate a better dataset to perform 
analysis. It will also help me to identify a pattern based on the results and see how team has 
performed over the years and what could be help them to win the match. 
5. The fifth objective is to perform analysis and create prediction and classification model. 
6. The final objective will be to complete the documentation with conclusion and use a 
visualization tool visualize the result. This will help the users such as cricket player, 
manager, bettors and cricket fans to predict and gain better understanding of the cricket 
matches. and transcribing text in the correct language.
